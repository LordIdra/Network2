Run the demonstration files. The project is compatible with 3.8 and 3.4 that I have tested. Optimisation wasn't really a priority so
there aren't many epochs or neurons used to conserve computing power(which in turn means results will not be accurate, but the decrease in cost is noticeable). Also note none of these use real datasets as I had trouble finding
any that could be used with a small number of neurons.
