Run the demonstration files. The project is compatible with 3.8 and 3.4 that I have tested. Optimisation wasn't really a priority so
there aren't many epochs or neurons used to conserve computing power. Also note none of these use real datasets as I had trouble finding
any that could be used with a small number of neurons.
